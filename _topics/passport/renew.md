## Renew an adult passport

Many people can renew their U.S. passports by mail. It costs $110 to renew a passport book, and the standard processing time is 6-8 weeks. 

Determine if you can renew your passport
You can renew your current or expired U.S. passport unless your passport was:
* Issued before your 16th birthday
* Issued 15 or more years ago
* Damaged, lost, or stolen
* Issued in your previous name and you don’t have a legal document like a marriage license to prove your legal name change
If any of these are true, you cannot renew your passport. Instead, you must apply for a new passport in person using form DS-11.
Items you need to renew your passport
* Application - You will need form DS-82. You can fill it out online or download it and fill it out by hand. You can also get form DS-82 at a local passport acceptance facility or regional agency. 
* Passport photo
* Payment 
* Your most recent passport
* Name change documentation if necessary.

Submit all your documentation and passport fees by mail. The Passport Services Office will return your official documents to you.

## If you need your passport quickly
If you need your passport in less than three weeks, follow the expedited process. It will cost an extra $60 plus any additional mail delivery fees.

## If you need to change your name or correct your passport
If you’ve changed your name or find an error on your passport, you will need to get a new passport to reflect the change. The process, cost and forms you need depend on how long you’ve had your current passport. Follow the steps from the State Department to make the change

## If you are outside the United States
Contact the U.S. embassy or consulate near you to request a passport while outside the United States. Expedited service is not available.
