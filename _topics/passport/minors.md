## Apply for or renew a passport for a minor under 18

Children must apply for or renew a passport in person at a passport acceptance facility. The cost will vary depending on the child’s age and if you are applying for the first time or renewing a passport. The standard processing time is 6-8 weeks. 

## Children under 16
A parent must be present and co-sign the passport application for children under 16.

Follow the step-by-step process from the State Department to ensure you have the proper forms and determine how much the passport will cost. For children getting a passport book, there are two fees totaling $115.

## Children ages 16-17
Children ages 16-17 can apply for their own passport if they have their identification documents. A parent will need to provide a signed statement saying they are aware the child is seeking a passport or attend the passport appointment with them.

Follow the step-by-step process from the State Department to ensure you have the proper forms and determine how much the passport will cost. For a passport book, there are two fees totaling $145. 

## Children in custody disputes
If you are concerned your child may be taken abroad by another legal guardian without your knowledge, you can enroll them in the Children’s Passport Issuance Alert Program (CPIAP).

## If you need your passport quickly
If you need your passport in less than three weeks, follow the expedited process. It will cost an extra $60 plus any additional mail delivery fees.

## If you are outside the United States
Contact the U.S. embassy or consulate near you to request a passport while outside the United States. Expedited service is not available.
